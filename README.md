# VISIONS
VISIONS is a Raspberry Pi–based system designed to reduce distracted driving by detecting phone usage while a vehicle is in motion and temporarily limiting phone interaction. The system automatically sends hands‑free replies, logs distraction events, and allows an emergency override. Unlike existing phone-based features. The purpose of this project is to create a system that helps prevent distracted driving; detecting if you are using your phone and disabling it. Nowadays, phones do have the ability to disable themselves while driving, but that feature needs to be enabled– it's not mandatory– with VISIONS the sensor will detect phone use, and disable it during driving periods, with automatic responses, and an override system in case of emergencies. In the past decade over 32,000 people died in distracted driving accidents and we’re helping reduce that amount. 
Shell coding is simple, reliable, and works well in the background while the system runsAt the beginning of the project, Python was used for both the detection logic and system control. While Python worked well for processing data and detecting phone use, it was not as reliable for handling startup, background processes, and system-level tasks on the Raspberry Pi. Managing automatic startup and restarts became complicated in Python, so the project switched to using shell scripts for these tasks. Shell coding is better suited for controlling the operating system and ensuring the program runs automatically and consistently. Python is still used for the main detection logic, while shell handles setup and automation.From our research, we learned that distracted driving happens when a driver’s attention is taken away from the road by texting, talking on the phone, eating or using navigation systems. Texting while driving is especially dangerous because it takes your hands, eyes and mind off of driving all at once. Even looking at a phone for a few seconds can mean traveling a long distance without watching the road, which greatly increases the chance of a crash. According to the Federal Communications Commission, ”In 2023, there were 3,275 people killed and nearly 325,000 people injured in traffic crashes involving distracted drivers” (FCC 2024). This shows us the huge effect of distracted drivers. Ignorance like distracted driving leads to hurting or killing other drivers. Research also shows that the human brain cannot safely multitask while driving, so even hands-free phone use can reduce awareness and reaction time. Distracted driving causes thousands of deaths and injuries each year in the United States, with teens and young drivers at higher risk. “Using a cell phone while driving creates enormous potential for deaths and injuries on U.S. roads. In 2023, 3,275 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers” (NHTSA). This shows us that you cannot drive safely unless the task of driving has your full attention. Any non-driving activity you engage in is a potential distraction and increases your risk of crashing.
