# VISIONS
VISIONS is a Raspberry Pi–based system designed to reduce distracted driving by detecting phone usage while a vehicle is in motion and temporarily limiting phone interaction. The system automatically sends hands‑free replies, logs distraction events, and allows an emergency override. Unlike existing phone-based features. The purpose of this project is to create a system that helps prevent distracted driving; detecting if you are using your phone and disabling it. Nowadays, phones do have the ability to disable themselves while driving, but that feature needs to be enabled– it's not mandatory– with VISIONS the sensor will detect phone use, and disable it during driving periods, with automatic responses, and an override system in case of emergencies. In the past decade over 32,000 people died in distracted driving accidents and we’re helping reduce that amount.
